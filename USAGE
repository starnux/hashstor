hashstor <command> [options]

Commands :
 - init [blocksize]
    Initialize an hashstor storage point in the current directory, with a 
    specific blocksize if specified
 - new [name]
    Create a new storage container, with an associated name if specified.
    In either cases, an UUID will be created and associated to the 
    specified name.
 - add <name or uuid> <file pathname> [container file path]
    Add a file to the specified storage container.
    The container path if not specified will be the filename, 
        e.g /path/to/my/file.txt -> "/file.txt"
    The specified container path must be a virtual UNIX path like "/directory/file.txt".
    If the file path is a directory, the directory files will be added recursivelly.
    The specified container path for the directory will replace the directory name.
    Examples :
     # hashstor add <uuid> /path/to/my/file.txt
        -> Stores "/file.txt"
     # hashstor add <uuid> /path/to/my/file.txt /public/file.txt
        -> Stores "/public/file.txt"
     # hashstor add <uuid> /path/to/my/directory
        -> Stores "/directory/file1.txt"
        -> Stores "/directory/subdir/file2.txt"
        -> Stores "/directory/subdir/subsubdir/file3.txt"
     # hashstor add <uuid> /path/to/my/directory /public
        -> Stores "/public/file1.txt"
        -> Stores "/public/subdir/file2.txt"
        -> Stores "/public/subdir/subsubdir/file3.txt"
 - rm <name or uuid>
    Delete the storage container, and its associated files and unused blocks.
 - ls <name or uuid>
    List the files into the specified storage container
 - cp <name or uuid> <virtual file path> <destination directory>
    Extracts the specified file into the destination directory from the specified
    storage container
 - check [name or uuid]
    Check storage point consistency.
    You can specify a storage container to check.
 - cleanup [name or uuid]
    Cleanup storage point if a previous action failed by removing unused blocks
    or files, a storage container can be specified.

TODO:
 - Extract a single storage container from the storage point to a new or 
    existing storage point
 - Add files to the storage point via SSH, permit the sender to get all 
    block hashs and files hashs in order to send only unknown blocks
